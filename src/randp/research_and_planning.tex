\section{Research Question}

How could social media delivery techniques be used in a digital news consumption platform to increase user engagement?

\section{Aims and Objectives}

  \subsection{Project Overview}

  This project aims to improve upon the flexibility and user engagement of
  traditional online news platforms, specifically those used by BBC News. The
  digital news landscape is changing rapidly, a report from Ofcom found that
  people in the UK are increasingly using digital platforms to consume news,
  often through the use of social media. This project proposes that adapting
  user interface techniques from social media and applying them to a news app
  would help to keep users on the news platform. The system created will also
  aim to be flexible so that it can adapt to future changes in the digital news
  world.

  The project will be content-agnostic so that it can work with any future media
  that may be devised. To achieve this the project will be divided into three
  parts: the feed, the catalogue and the scrapers. The feed will be an app that
  users can interact with. It will need to intelligently select content from the
  catalogue and present it to the user for consumption. The catalogue will store
  content that can be displayed, this will aim to be fast to access, and well
  organised to ensure a smooth flow of content to the users. The scrapers will
  create the content for the catalogue by connecting to various BBC news data
  sources. They will read this content, translate it into a form suitable for
  the catalogue and store it. Each one will have to be custom made for the
  various content sources.

  \subsection{Key Terminology}

  \subsection{Deliverables and Goals}

  The deliverables for this project will be the three components highlighted
  above, as well as all documentation require to understand, maintain, deploy
  and use the system. The documentation will be provided as HTML pages alongside
  documentation within the codebase. All code produced will be written in
  Python.

    \subsubsection{The Feed}

    This deliverable will be a Python Flask application that can either be run
    locally or deployed to a web server. It will have accompanying scripts that
    install any pre-requisites for running the application. This deliverable
    will depend on having a valid catalogue to read from. If the hosted
    catalogue is unavailable there will be options to read from a local version.

    \subsubsection{The Catalogue}

    This deliverable will take the form of an SQL database schema. The database
    that it describes will be hosted on an AWS RDS instance. As this may not be
    available at all times the feed deliverable will have the ability to deploy
    a local database the read from instead.

    \subsubsection{The Scrapers}

    This part of the project consists of several independent scripts, each will
    be tailored to a specific BBC data source. The specifics for language,
    running and hosting will vary between the scripts. They will each come with
    appropriate documentation.

  \subsection{Out of Scope Issues}

  This project is primarily focused on the engineering challenges of developing
  this system, as such it will not be attempting to measure user experiences in
  any way. The project will also not explore algorithms for choosing which
  content to display to users, it will however provide capacity for this
  functionality to be added at a later date. These topics are highly important
  to the problem space being explored, however they each could constitute a
  project in their own right and would spread the focus of this project too
  thin. These two issues would make for excellent follow up projects however so
  some comments may be made where relevant to future research.

\section{Background and Rationale}

  \subsection{Overview of the Problem Space}

  Modern news consumption started with the newspaper. Despite moving to online
  platforms these roots can still be seen in the user interfaces of digital news
  platforms such as the BBC News website and mobile app. These interfaces
  broadly function by providing categories of content to browse, this makes
  these interfaces good for researching topics and for getting an overview of
  recent news within a topic \cite{dummy}. Social media instead often delivers
  content to users through an infinitely scrolling feed. This style of interface
  fits well with short bursts of interaction, such as while waiting for a kettle
  to boil or waiting for a bus. In these scenarios users often want to consume
  content without having to choose a category or risk running out of content.

  This style of interface removes the need for the end user to decide what
  content they consume at the point of consumption, instead they control what
  content is presented to them by following, liking, subscribing to or otherwise
  choosing to receive content from a number of sources. From this user input a
  social media platform will choose exactly which content to provide to a user,
  and in which order. The specifics of how these decisions are made are closely
  guarded secrets, and as such will not be investigated here.

  It is preferential to deliver news to users on a first party platform, such as
  the app or website of the news producer. This gives the producers of the
  content more control over how it is presented and consumed. T
